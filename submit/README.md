`main.ipynb` contains all code necessary to train and test the models and do all our experiments. 
To reproduce the results, just specify the hyperparameters and run the cells in order. 
In the model part, pick one of the model classes (e.g., ResNet18) and instantiate it as `model`. 
Depending on the best validation accuracy found in the training stage, the number of epoches needs to be changed accordingly when training on all available data.
